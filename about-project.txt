UN Portal is basically a student portal where students can see their Academic information (e.g., instructors, subjects enrolled, exams such as quizzes, Assignments, etc's marks).

Following is the Summary / Flow of the Project:

1) The instructor first makes his account if he has not signed up before (otherwise he will simply log in).
2) The instructor will register his students one by one and assign each student a unique student ID.
3) After registering the students, he can post marks of different activities done in class against each student's record.
4) Then students can log in to their accounts through the Student ID and password provided by their instructor.
5) Students can check their received marks in different subjects enrolled by their instructors.


CRUD Functionality

- Both students and instructors can edit their account info
- Admin authorities are also added (The only admin can delete any instructor)
